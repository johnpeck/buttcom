	{\huge ASCII command interface for the AVR Butterfly}\\
	\today
\end{center}



\section{Introduction}
I love test equipment with open, well documented, ASCII command sets.  The plain text commands give a complicated instrument a familiar interface and an easy way to automate measurements.  Python's gnuplot and pySerial interfaces let me acquire and make pretty plots of my data -- all for free\cite{pyserial,gnuplot-py}. So when I needed to automate reading the voltage output from an ultrasonic rangefinder at home, I wished for an ASCII interface to a voltmeter.  But I needed more than just a voltmeter, since I wanted this meter to also convert volts into distance.  I had an AVR Butterfly, and I thought that it should be easy to give it a plain text interface to a PC.  This became a bigger project than I expected.  What I came up with is a simple command interface that's easy for me to customize and extend.  It's not at the level of a commercial instrument, but it works just fine for sending a few commands and getting some data back.

\section{Working with the Butterfly}
The AVR Butterfly board consists of an AVR ATmega169 microcontroller (uC) and some peripherals.  Figure \ref{fig:connections} shows the connections I make to it.  I only use 3 wires from the DB9 connector for serial communication with the PC -- there's no hardware handshaking.  And while I could also use this serial channel for programming, I find that using a dedicated programmer makes iterating my code much faster.  A 6-pin header soldered to the J403 position lets me use Atmel's AVRISP mkII programmer.  Finally, powering the board with an external supply at J401 means that I don't have to think about the Butterfly's button cell battery.  I did, however, need to worry about the minimum power-on reset slope rate.  The uC won't reset at power-on unless the power supply is able to ramp from about 1V to 3V at more than 0.1V/ms.  I had to reduce a filter capacitor in my power supply circuit to increase its power-on ramp rate.  With that settled, the uC now starts executing code when I turn the power supply on.

After the hardware is connected, I use \textbf{avrdude}\cite{avrdude} and \textbf{GNU make}\cite{gnumake} to automate building the code and programming the Butterfly's flash memory.  I modified a makefile template from the WinAVR project\cite{winavr} to specify my part, programmer, and source files.  The comments in this template file were a big help for understanding how to customize it, and for understanding the build process in general.  Finally, I installed \textbf{avr-gcc} and other cross-compilation tools using Gentoo Linux's \textbf{crossdev} package.  I could have put these last pieces on ``by hand'', but \textbf{crossdev} conveniently updates the toolchain as new versions are released.

\section{Handling incoming characters}
Receiving remote commands begins with receiving characters, which are sent to the AVR via the USART connector shown in figure \ref{fig:connections}.  Reception of these characters triggers an interrupt service routine (ISR), which handles them according to the flow shown in figure \ref{fig:recflow}. The first step in this flow is loading the characters into the receive buffer.

Figure \ref{fig:recbuffer} illustrates the receive buffer loaded with a combined string.  The buffer is accessed with a pointer to its beginning and a second pointing to the next index to be written.  These pointers are members of the \texttt{recv\_cmd\_state\_t} type variable \texttt{recv\_cmd\_state}.  This is just style -- I like to try to organize variables used in a flow by making them members of their own structure.  Naming conventions aside, it's important to notice that there are no limitations on command or argument size imposed in this first step, provided that the total character count stays under the \texttt{RECEIVE\_BUFFER\_SIZE} limit. 
 
When a combined string in the receive buffer is finished with a carriage return, the string is copied over to a second buffer.  I call this the parse buffer, since this is where the string will be searched for recognized commands and arguments.  This buffer is locked until its contents can be processed to keep it from being clobbered by new combined strings.  Sending commands faster than they can be processed will generate an error, and combined strings sent to a locked parse buffer will be dropped.  The maximum command processing frequency will depend on the system clock and other system tasks.  Not having larger parse or receive buffers is a limitation that puts this project at the hobby level.  Extending these buffers to hold more than just one command would make the system more robust.

\section{Watching the progress}
I set up a logging system to help me understand how commands were being processed.  It's inconvenient to have the command and logging interfaces share the same communication channel, but the Butterfly only has one USART.  Reading command replies back without getting confused by general log messages requires some control over how the logging system works.  For now, figure \ref{fig:hellotrace} shows the system processing the \texttt{hello} command with logging enabled at its most verbose level.  Each log message is tagged with a character representing the message severity (ISR, information, warning, error), followed by a string representing the subsystem responsible for the message.  These tags can be used to adjust what log messages should be suppressed.  The ``ISR'' tag doesn't seem like it should represent a message severity level, but I needed a way to quickly veto messages generated in the ISR.  Using the system name requires string comparisons, while the severity level is just an integer.  The last ``Hello yourself!'' message shown in figure \ref{fig:hellotrace} is the reply to the \texttt{hello} command. This reply isn't a log message, and thus has no tags.

I should mention that these log message strings can easily overwhelm the Butterfly's RAM if they're not stored and referenced in flash memory.  Savannah\cite{url:savannah:pgmspace} and Dean Camera\cite{url:deancamera:pgmspace} have written great instructions for using the pgmspace module to handle this problem.  This module supplies the PROGMEM and PSTR macros I use throughout my code.

\section{Configuring the logger}
The logger acts as a gatekeeper for messages emitted from other subsystems.  In the output shown in figure \ref{fig:hellotrace}, the \texttt{command} subsystem has a lot to say about every character received over the USART.  At 9600 buad, sending an 80-character message (10 bits per character) takes almost 100 milliseconds.  The processor will not be able to handle new commands (or even new characters) during this time, as it won't get around to processing the parse buffer or even finishing the interrupt.  So we need to suppress messages we don't need to see.  

Messages are sent to the logger using the \texttt{logger\_msg\_p} function, where the \texttt{\_p} suffix indicates that the message must be stored and referenced in flash memory.  These messages are tagged with the origin subsystem and a severity level.  These two tags have corresponding members in the logger configuration structure, which the logger consults when deciding whether or not to print the message.  The system boots with the severity level set above ISR.  If it didn't, you'd have to send characters spaced by about 100ms to send commands.  After the system boots, you can use the commands \texttt{logreg} and \texttt{loglevel} to customize which systems to print messages from and how severe they have to be.  To describe these commands, I first need to say something about how the logger sorts messages.

The logger first checks to see if logging has been turned off.  Clearing all bits in a logger configuration register does this, and is the fastest way to veto all messages.  If logging hasn't been turned off, the incoming message's severity is compared with the configuration level.  This level is an enumerated type, with the \texttt{log\_level\_ISR} member given the lowest value and \texttt{log\_level\_ERROR} given the highest.  If the severity is high enough, the logger checks to see if the message's subsystem has been enabled for logging.  Subsystem tags are recognized by comparing the tag string with strings in the logger module's system array.  This can be slow, and it's why I veto messages from the ISR with a severity level and not by disabling subsystems.  Each subsystem has one bit in a 16-bit register -- the logger configuration register.  Setting the bit enables the subsystem's messages, and clearing it suppresses them.  Clearing all bits sets the ``logger is turned off'' state described earlier.  The \texttt{logreg} remote command allows users to set bits in this register while the system is running.  Of course, the user has to be told how to match bit positions with subsystems for this command to be useful.  The \texttt{loglevel} command is more intuitive -- taking an integer from 0 to 3 to set the severity threshold, with 3 being the most severe.   

Each subsystem needs an entry in the logger's subsystem array for this scheme to work.  It might be nice to automate the creation of this array so that the programmer doesn't have to think about it when adding a new subsystem.  For now, the logger module must be made aware of new subsystems by manually adding these array entries.

\section{Recognizing commands}
After finished combined strings are copied from the receive to the parse buffer, the system separates them into command and argument strings using the flow shown in figure \ref{fig:cmdflow}.  Commands in the parse buffer are then separated from their arguments with a string terminator inserted into the first space between the two.  As illustrated in figure \ref{fig:prsbuffer}, pointers to the beginning of the parse buffer and the beginning of the argument will then reference two separate strings.  The first of these two, the command string, is converted to lowercase and compared with those in the command definition array to look for a match.

The lower section of listing \ref{lst:cmdsnip} shows my simple command definition array with entries for the ``hello,'' ``logreg,'' ``logreg?,'' and ``help'' commands. The structure of this array is largely taken from White\cite{bok:white2012}.  Each entry must be of the type \texttt{command\_t}, defined in the upper section of listing \ref{lst:cmdsnip}.  Notice that the function pointer member of this command type only accepts one integer argument.  This can be changed to make the system more flexible, but remember that every function called by remote commands must accept the same arguments.  If the function pointer is expanded to accept both an integer and a string pointer argument, all of the functions the pointer will point to must also be expanded.  

The other members of the command type contain the command's name (must be lowercase), its argument type, the maximum number of characters in the argument, and a help string.  The argument type tells the command processing system how it should handle the argument string.  Hexadecimal argument strings, for example, are converted to integers before being passed on.  The character limit is a basic way of limiting incoming arguments.  Finally, the help string is what is printed to the USART when the ``help'' command is issued.

\section{Adding more commands}
Since being able to extend this system is so important, I've come up with a procedure for adding new commands.  First, choose the name of your command.  This can be harder than it sounds.  I like names to be short enough to be easily entered on the command line, but long enough to be descriptive.  The name can contain any ASCII character except a space.  Remember that the command characters, the argument characters, one space, and one string terminator must all fit in the received character buffer.
    
Next, decide whether or not you need more than an unsigned hexadecimal integer string argument.  My argument handling ability is limited to just hexadecimal integer strings.  Extending the system isn't hard, but remember that every function called by a command has to accept the same arguments.  If you add a character pointer argument, even commands that take no arguments must then call functions that need both integer and character pointer arguments.  This can be tedious if you already have a lot of commands defined.

If your arguments fit your ability to handle them, add a function for your command to call.  You might like to put all the functions called by remote commands in their own module.  I prefer to put these functions in the module they're associated with, and I prefix their names with ``cmd\_.'' For example, the function called by the \texttt{logreg} remote command is \texttt{cmd\_logreg}, and I implement it in the \texttt{bc\_logger} module.

Now that the command's attributes have been specified, it's time to give it an entry in the command array.  Add the new entry before the array's end marker.  You've already chosen the command's name, argument type, and function call.  The remaining entry members are the argument's maximum size in characters and the command's help string.  Remember that hexadecimal arguments larger than 4 characters don't make sense for 16-bit integers.  As for the help strings, I was only able to use the PROGMEM macro on them if I defined them outside of the command array.  This breaks up the array organization, but these strings will quickly eat up the Butterfly's RAM if they're not located and referenced in flash.

\section{Sending calibration values}
My original goal was to calibrate measurements made with the Butterfly's voltage reader, and to read those measurements using the PC.  I added the commands \texttt{vcounts?}, \texttt{volt?}, \texttt{vslope}, and \texttt{voffset} to handle the calibration flow.  The \texttt{vcounts?} query returns raw counts from the voltage reader's ADC, and \texttt{volt?} returns the calibrated measurement.  Raw counts are multiplied by the factor set with \texttt{vslope}, and that product is divided by 16 to get the voltage reading in millivolts including offset.  If there's offset, it can be subtracted off by sending the number of millivolts to subtract with \texttt{voffset}.  Of course, the functions I call with commands only accept positive integers, so the offset value can't be negative.  I didn't have a problem with this here, but providing for a negative offset or slope factor would be a good reason to extend the arguments accepted by these functions.

Figure \ref{fig:caltrace} shows the logger output during calibration of the voltage reader.  I used the power supply rail (3.308V) and ground as references.  The slope factor comes from
\begin{equation}
    \mathtt{vslope} = 16 \left( \frac{V_h - V_{\ell}}{N_h - N_{\ell}} \right) =
        16 \left( \frac{3308 - 0}{180 - 0} \right) = 294
\end{equation}
where $V_h$ and $V_{\ell}$ are the voltage references in millivolts, and $N_h$ and $N_{\ell}$ are the raw ADC counts at those references.  The factor of 16 increases my calibration precision while constraining the system to measure less than about 3.5V.  After sending the slope factor, I can measure the ground reference again to see if I need to adjust offset.  There isn't any (within my roughly 20 millivolt precision), so the last line of figure \ref{fig:caltrace} shows the calibrated result of measuring the power supply rail.  Why is the result 3307 instead of 3308?  I divide the product of the raw ADC counts and the slope factor by 16 with a simple bit shift -- discarding the fractional remainder instead of rounding it properly.  The Butterfly's voltage reader isn't a good way to make a measurement with millivolts of precision anyway.

I use these two outputs to calculate a calibration factor, and apply it with the \texttt{vslope} command.  There is no offset needed.  The final output shows the power supply measurement reported in fixed-point millivolts.\label{fig:caltrace}}

\section{Conclusion: Is there any space left?}
I built the code with avr-gcc, using the -Os optimization level.  The output of \textbf{avr-gcc} \verb8--8\textbf{version} is: \texttt{avr-gcc (Gentoo 4.6.3 p1.3, pie-0.5.1) 4.6.3}. The resulting memory map file shows a \texttt{.data} size of 308 bytes, a \texttt{.bss} size of 100 bytes, and a \texttt{.text} size of 8.9 kilobytes.  I'm using roughly half of the Butterfly's flash and almost half of its RAM.  So there's at least some space left to do more than just recognizing commands and calibrating voltages.  I'd like to work on extending the system to handle more types of arguments, like signed integers and floats.  And I'd like to port the system to a different part -- one with more than one USART.  Then I could have a dedicated logging port, and log messages wouldn't get in the way of other communication.  Making well-documented interfaces to my designs would help me with my long term goal of making them more modular.
