* buttcom progress
* ----------------------- Dated notes ---------------------------
* <2012-04-12 Thu> Created this project
* --------------------- Specifications --------------------------
* TODO User should be told how to issue a log message
* TODO User should be told what the limitations on commands are
   - Size in RAM
   - Maximum buffer length

* TODO User should understand how incoming characters are sorted
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* TODO Move the code over from parkdar [/]
  - The idea is that I'll get the code to work in parkdar, then I'll copy over the relevant bits to buttcom.  The relevent bits would most notably be the command and logging modules.
** TODO Create a new main file that will just contain a call to command processor
** TODO Copy over the usart module.  Just call it bc_usart.
** TODO Copy over the command module.  Call it bc_command.
** TODO Copy over the logger module.  Call it bc_logger.
* DONE Add a reference to Python's gnuplot interface
* DONE Revise the drawing showing connections to the Butterfly [3/3]
** DONE DB9 pins should come out of the page
** DONE Show the AVRISP connector and box
** DONE Add power connections
* TODO Check received character flow against actual code
  - Do this after copying code over.  I want documented code as actual buttcom code.
* TODO Update termgrab.sh to also dump image in gif format
