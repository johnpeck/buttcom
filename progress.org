* ----------------------- Dated notes ---------------------------
* <2012-04-12 Thu> Created this project
* --------------------- Specifications --------------------------
* The user understands the limitations on remote commands and their arguments.
* The user understands how to call functions with remote commands.
* The user understands how to add another remote command
* The user understands how to use a single port for debug and interface
* Code has a command called "hello" that just returns "hello yourself"
* Code has a command that sets slope for voltage measurements
* Code has a command that sets offset for voltage measurements
* Code has a command that returns a calibrated voltage measurement of the supply voltage
* Commands must not be case sensitive
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* DONE Add a section describing how to use the logger module
* DONE Add the rxchar subsystem [3/3]
** DONE Make log messages from the received character ISR have the rxchar subsystem tag
** DONE Regenerate the "watching the progress figure," as the subsystem tags will have changed
** DONE Add an entry in logger.c for the new system
* DONE Add the logreg? command to query the logger config register [3/3]
** DONE Regenerate the command array listing, as the array will have increased
** DONE Add a function in logger.h and logger.c to handle the command
** DONE Follow your "adding a new command" procedure to check the procedure
* DONE Make a script to generate the "watching the progress" figure [2/2]
** DONE Just types hello and gets the reply
** DONE Add this to the makefile
* DONE Add a note about naming callback functions
** I say that I don't worry about putting all remote commands in their own module.  I should further say that I try to put commands in the module they relate to.
* TODO Add a new figure -- using the logger [/]
  - Capture the output just after turning off the rxchar system
** TODO Send the logreg? command
** TODO Send the hello command
** TODO Send the logreg command to turn rxchar logging back on
** TODO Type an h
** TODO Add this figure generation to the makefile
** TODO Make a note about sending commands at full speed with rxchar logging on
   - If I write a script to send "hello" with no time delay between characters, only the string "hel" is received before a carriage return.  Obviously, the command is not recognized.
* TODO Add a new section -- using remote commands to set calibration values [4/9] :1day:
  - Call the section: Setting calibration values
** TODO Add the vgain command
** TODO Add the voffs command
** DONE Add an ADC calibration structure to hold slope and offset values
** TODO Add the vcounts? command to get raw adc counts from the ADC
** DONE Add an ADC module to the system
** DONE Revisit the ADC prescaler problem to get more single-shot precision
** TODO Add the volt? command to query the voltage measurement
** DONE Modify the hardware connection diagram to include the voltage measurement port
** TODO Show trace of measurement of Vcc after sending calibration values (return Vcc in decimal mV)
* DONE Add a paragraph describing problems with power supply turnon ramp rate
* TODO Meet Circuit Cellar requirements [5/7]			       :1day:
** TODO Article should be 2500 to 3500 words long
** TODO Figures with a lot of text must be in TIF format (no compression) (300dpi) (4x4 inches)
** DONE Expand figure captions to be 2-3 sentences
** DONE Add a biography
** DONE Add a phone number and mailing address
** DONE No more than 10 figures or listings
** DONE Get rid of the numbered list.  Text must be in paragraph format.
* TODO Make a submit target to create the text file and copy figures for submission :1day:
* TODO Create second submission to CC following the recommended guidelines from CJ email
* DONE Add a hello command
  - A simple command to illustrate how the character handling works.
** Arguments: none
** Returns: "Hello yourself!"
* DONE Add a help command
  - A command to print out all the help strings.
** Arguments: none
** Returns: All the command help strings
* DONE Work on watching the progress section
  - This section will describe how the logger functions can be used to turn off debugging output.
  - The system will boot with logging completely enabled.
  - Use the logall command to log all sytems at the info level
  - Use logreg 0 to turn logging off again
** DONE Add a citation for Dean Camera here.  Something like: These log strings can take up a lot of space in RAM, but they can be easily referenced in flash instead using the pgmspace module.  Dean Camera has written a nice explanation of how this works.

** DONE Make a putty screenshot showing processing of the hello command.  This needs to go into the watching the progress section.
* DONE Add a note about the command array
** If you want to let the user pass arguments of other types, just change the definition of the command type to take more arguments.  For example, if you want to handle string arguments, you might add a character pointer argument to the command type definition.
* DONE Modify the command array code listing to have two sections: one for the command_t definition, and the other for the command array.
  DEADLINE: <2012-06-08 Fri>
* TODO All include files need guards
  - look at bc_command.h for an example
* Add references
** TODO Add reference to Elicia White
* DONE Revise the drawing showing connections to the Butterfly [4/4]
** DONE DB9 pins should come out of the page
** DONE Show the AVRISP connector and box
** DONE Add power connections
** DONE Reduce the length of the ribbon cable
* DONE Use tikz to fix up received character flow diagram
* DONE Create the parse buffer figure
** This will show where the string terminators are inserted.  Need to get the pointer names correct.
** DONE Check the parse buffer figure against the xfig flow diagram.
* DONE Add a section describing the toolchain
** The section should say that the code was built with avr-gcc, and it should list the RAM and flash sizes as percentages and absolute values.
* DONE Add a set of instructions for adding remote commands
* DONE Work on the command processing flow diagram [2/2]
** DONE Add a step showing conversion of the command to lower case
** DONE Make the diagram more compact
   - Suggestion: Move the execute command box to be above is the command within limits
* DONE Add a reference to winavr for their makefile
* DONE Better document bc_usart.h
* DONE Better document bc_usart.c
* TODO Better document bc_logger.h
* TODO Better document bc_logger.c
